_Again I was too late.. There are other projects in the meantime.. For example this from O'Reilly for EPUB etc. reading: http://code.google.com/p/threepress/ - and a management one in Ruby... What doesn't mean that I won't start.. But I will start on new ideas first.. This time I didnt make the mistake and put my ideas online, where someone could steal them.. I put it up when its actually in a working state.._

Its will be little tool built around Mark Pilgrim's great PyAmazon code, because I found that there seem to be no tools around there..

Similar tools to mine are Alexandria (Ruby & Gtk) and Tellico (Qt) but Tellico uses its own storage format instead of MySQL oder Sqlite, and Alexandria has a broken Internet Search who nobody seems to fix, as long it works in the United States.. ;)

Bookpyle will be a web based tool, written in Django or Flask.
Perhaps I also host a own site for those who cannot install it for themselves.
